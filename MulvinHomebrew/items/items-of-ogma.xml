			<p>A sword passed down through the ages, crafted by Oghma. This longsword is a well-crafted tool, too elegant to be called a weapon </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> Legendmaker is a sentient true neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 19, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing, telepathy, and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, and Halfling.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The Legendmaker is proud of itself and who made it. It tends to ramble on and on about things it has learned while travelling the lands. THe only thing that will shut it up is more knowledge.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The longsword grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can speak, read, and write Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, and Halfling.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
				<li>You are able to cast the spell <em>Identify</em> through the sword without using a spell slot.</li>
