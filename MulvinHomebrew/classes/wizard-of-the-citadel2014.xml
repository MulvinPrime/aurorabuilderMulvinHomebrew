			<p>Through diligent study, you’ve learned esoteric tricks, twists, and shortcuts of spellcasting methodology, and can modulate your spells as you cast them. You gain three spellcraft secrets of your choice from among those described in the “Spellcraft Secrets Options” section later in this subclass’s description. Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 3, you gain one additional secret of your choice. You can use only one secret on a spell when you cast it. If a secret calls for a saving throw, use your spell save DC if no other DC is specified. You can modify a Wizard spell with a secret a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest. Additionally, whenever you gain a Wizard level, you can choose one of the secrets you know and replace it with another secret.</p>

			<p>You learn to map out your spells to speed your ritual spellcasting. When you cast a spell as a ritual, you can draw a 15-foot-radius arcane diagram on a flat, level surface, using chalk, salt, blood, or another material suitable to the spell in question. Once the first ritual casting is complete, you can cast the same spell as a ritual without spending the additional 10 minutes so long as you are within the boundaries of the diagram. A creature within 5 feet of the diagram can use an action to scuff it, ending this effect. Likewise, running water, strong winds, and other such forces can destroy the diagram. You can maintain a number of diagrams equal to your Proficiency Bonus. If you exceed your maximum number of diagrams, your oldest diagram immediately loses its magical properties.</p>

			<p>The Citadel reminds its scholars to step out of the ivory tower and undertake creative labors. Choose one of the following fields of applied arcana and gain the associated feature.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Alchemy.</strong> You dedicate yourself to the art of alchemy, drawing upon its healing and transformative aspect—as well as its fulminatinfulminating and destructive side. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain proficiency with Alchemist’s Supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.</li>
				<li>When you use an action or Bonus Action to drink a potion that restores Hit Points or administer such a potion to another creature, or to throw a vial of Acid or a flask of Alchemist’s Fire, you can double the number of Hit Points regained or damage dealt.</li>
				<li>When you drink a potion, roll a d6; on a 6, you gain the benefit of the potion with only the barest sip, and the potion isn’t expended.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Celestial Navigation.</strong> You study the patterns of the stars and planets in their eternal cycles. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain proficiency with Navigator’s Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency with Cartographer's Tools, or another type of tools of your choice.</li>
				<li>When you travel using Navigator’s Tools or a map of the region, your superior navigation doubles your pace, and that of creatures traveling with you.</li>
				<li>You add the Dimension Door and Misty Step spells to your spellbook if they are not there already. You automatically have the spells prepared and they don’t count against the number of spells you prepare. The maximum distance you can teleport when you cast them is doubled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Forge Magic.</strong> You work the forge and weave the subtle spells of smiths into molten steel and polished silver. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain proficiency with Smith’s Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.</li>
				<li>You can attune to a fourth magic item. The item must be a Ring, Rod, Staff, Wand, or Weapon.</li>
				<li>You add the Magic Weapon and Elemental Weapon spells to your spellbook if they are not there already, and they count as Wizard spells for you. You automatically have the spells prepared and they don’t count against the number of spells you prepare. While you are concentrating on either of these spells, your Concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Inscription.</strong> Every Wizard must write in their spellbook, but some elevate this art form with calligraphy and illumination. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain proficiency with Calligrapher’s Supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.</li>
				<li>You are adept at empowering the release of inscribed magical energy. When you cast a spell from a Spell Scroll, roll a d6. On a 4 or 5, the spell takes effect as if it was cast with a spell slot one level higher. On a 6, the spell takes effect as if it was cast with a spell slot two levels higher.</li>
				<li>The time and cost to add a new spell into your spellbook is halved. Additionally, when you copy a spell from a Spell Scroll into your spellbook, the scroll isn’t destroyed.</li>
